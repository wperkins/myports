description         Modular Aquatic Simulation System 1D
long_description    MASS1 is a one-dimensional unsteady hydrodynamic \
                    and water quality model capable of simulating open \
                    channel flows, water surface elevations, dissolved \
                    gas, and water temperature. The model is \
                    applicable to any branched channel system. Because \
                    MASS1 uses cross-section averaging, only single \
                    values of water surface elevation, velocity, \
                    discharge, and temperature are produced at each \
                    cross-section location along the river \
                    course. Lateral (i.e., across the river channel) \
                    and vertical variations of these quantities are \
                    not simulated.
