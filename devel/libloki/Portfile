description         C++ library implementating common design patterns and idioms.

long_description    \
    From Wikipedia: Loki is the name of a C++ software library written \
    by Andrei Alexandrescu as part of his book Modern C++ Design. \
    The library makes extensive use of C++ template metaprogramming \
    and implements several commonly used tools: typelist, functor, \
    singleton, smart pointer, object factory, visitor and \
    multimethods. \
    Originally the library was only compatible with two of the most \
    standard conforming C++ compilers (CodeWarrior and Comeau C/C++): \
    later efforts have made it usable with a wide array of compilers \
    (including older Visual C++ 6.0, Borland C++ Builder 6.0, Clang \
    and GCC). Compiler vendors used Loki as a compatibility benchmark, \
    further increasing the number of compliant compilers. \
    Maintenance and further development of Loki has been continued \
    through an open-source community led by Peter KÃ¼mmel and Richard \
    Sposato as a SourceForge project. Ongoing contributions by many \
    people have improved the overall robustness and functionality of \
    the library. Loki is not tied to the book anymore as it already \
    has a lot of new components (e.g. StrongPtr, Printf, and \
    Scopeguard). Loki inspired similar tools and functionality now \
    also present in the Boost library collection. \
